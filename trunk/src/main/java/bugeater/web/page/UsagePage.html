		<h3><a id="categorization">Categorization of Issues</a></h3>
		<p>
			Issues are categorized by project and category (type).  Project is a
			software project.  This could be the name of the software, or a
			subsystem in a software project.  The category could be a bug
			(defect), a request for new functionallity, or a request for a
			change in existing functionallity.  Both the list of projects and
			the categories may be modified by the administrator of the Bugeater
			system.
		</p>
		<h3><a id="watching_issues">Watching Issues for Changes</a></h3>
		<p>
			Issues may be tracked by any user.  All the user has to do is click
			on the watch icon <img src="images/watch.png"/>.  The
			user will then be notified through email any time a new note is
			entered for the issue or the issue's status has changed.  If a user
			no longer wants to be notified of changes, he may click on the
			no-watch icon <img src="images/nowatch.png"/>.  The creator of an
			issue and the user to which the issue is assigned are automatically
			assigned to the issue's list of watchers.
		</p>
		<h3><a id="roles">User Roles</a></h3>
		<p>
			There are several roles to which a users may be assigned.  A user
			may (and should) be assigned to more than one role.  For instance.
			all users, no matter what other roles they fill, must also fill
			the user role.
			<ul>
				<li>
					<em>Administrator</em> - The administrator has the ability
					to maintain lists of categories, projects, and project
					release versions.
				</li>
				<li>
					<em>Developer</em> - A software developer is responsible for
					making changes in the software's code.  Developers may have
					issues assigned to them.  They may also create new issues.
				</li>
				<li>
					<em>Manager</em> - The manager of a software development or
					testing (quality assurance) team.  Managers may have issues
					assigned to them.  They may also create new issues.
				</li>
				<li>
					<em>Tester</em> - The tester is responsible for testing
					changes to ensure that they work as indicated by the
					reported issues and that no new bugs where created while
					fixing/implementing the reported issues.  Testers may have
					issues assigned to them.  They may also create new issues.
				</li>
				<li>
					<em>User</em> - The user is anyone with access to the site.
					Users may log in, view issues, search for them. and watch
					issues.  However, they may not create issues, nor may they
					have issues assigned to them.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h3><a id="statuses">Issue Status</a></h3>
		<p>
			Issues may be assigned one of several statuses that indicate what
			progress has been made to resolve them.
			<ul>
				<li>
					<em>Active</em> - Indicates that a developer is currently
					working to fix, or implement the issue.
				</li>
				<li>
					<em>Closed Duplicate</em> - Indicates that an issue was
					closed and will not be fixed or implemented because it
					duplicates another issue that has already been recorded.
				</li>
				<li>
					<em>Closed Fixed</em> - Indicates that an issue was closed
					because it has been fixed or implemented.
				</li>
				<li>
					<em>Closed No Fix</em> - Indicates that an issue was closed
					and will not be fixed.  The reason that the issue will not
					be fixed or implemented should be noted in the issue.
				</li>
				<li>
					<em>Open</em> - Indicates that an issue is open and has not
					yet been worked.  This is the default status of a new issue.
				</li>
				<li>
					<em>Testing</em> - Indicates that an issue has been fixed
					or implemented and is being tested to ensure it works as
					it should and that no new bugs where created in the
					process.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h3><a id="notes">Notes</a></h3>
		<p>
			Notes may be added to an issue at any time.  Notes are also required
			each time the status of an issue is changed.  The date and time
			the note is created as well as the creator of the issue is tracked.
			Notes are shown on the issue view page in chronological order.
		</p>
		<p>
			Notes can be formatted using a wiki-like syntax.  The wiki syntax
			is regular text with symbols inserted in such a way as to give
			bugtracker hints about how the text should be formatted.  For
			example: <code>__My Bold Statement__</code> will show as
			<b>My Bold Statement</b> and <code>~~My Italics Text~~</code> will
			show as <i>My Italics Text</i>.  Other, more complex formatting
			such as text size, color, and even tables are available.  See the
			<a href="#" target="_blank" wicket:id="formattinglink">note
			formatting instructions</a> for more detail.
		</p>
		<h3><a id="attachments">Attachments</a></h3>
		<p>
			Files of any type may be attached to an issue for others to
			download and reference.  Good examples of attachments might be
			screenshots showing a bug, documents that describe how new
			functionality is to work in detail, or any other file that can
			lend understanding about the issue.  Attachments can be uploaded on
			the issue view page.  Once a new issue has been created, bugtracker
			shows the new issue in the view page.  Therefore, attachments can
			be uploaded right after a new issue has been created.
